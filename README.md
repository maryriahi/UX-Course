## Objective
Everyone likes to play board games! But off-late people are choosing electronic games over physical games.
There are many reasons for that, and in this project we are trying to solve two of them. 
Combining the best of both worlds and introducing Augmented Reality Board Games in our project helps in making board gaming
experience more interesting.

# Project Mission
We discussed different solutions and went through various steps to come up with a good idea and implement a prototype which can solves these problems in the new AR/VR board game. 

## Step 1: Research

Goals:
Improve User Experience
Add new features
Make games more enjoyable in AR

Challenges:
Navigating across the board game
Inefficient controllers
Space utilization
Limited number of players

Target:
Better Space Utilization
More number of players



## Step 2: Generate

Selescted idea: 
Physical board+ virtual components
virtual board+ physical components


## Step 3: Choose:
Mixed reality - After coming up with various ideas from each member of our team we voted on the best idea and chose mixed reality

Tools:
Unity 3D
Vuforia library
Camera
No access to AR HMD

## Step 4: Prototype
Prototype video can was shown above and be found here:

## Step 5: Interview and Evaluation
We asked a number of volunteers to use the prototype and we did interview with them after playing with our AR board game.

The interview had the following questions:

How often do you play board games? Have you experienced AR/VR products before? 
Is there any type of board games that you think can be improved by AR? 
Would you prefer completely virtual, completely physical environments for gaming or a mix of physical and virtual components? Why? 
What's the biggest problem with AR/VR board games? 
What aspects of games would you want to control with the customizable controller?


## Results and observations 
Positive:
Customizable Controller was considered as a fascinating and novel idea.
Most people wanted to control more than one aspect with the controller
Selection using the controller was a good suggested idea
Feedback on Mixed Reality was that it definitely improves tangibility

Negative:
Many people were concerned about the technical aspects
Cost of VR was a big issue
Concerns about adaptability to different types of games
Mixed reality was not perceived to make a huge difference
